                This is the flad of England, it's origin can be traced back to the 
                late middle ages and is derived from saint George's cross.

            <br>
            <p>
                It also forms an integral part of the union jack, which is the
                flag of the United Kingdom.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Since the 1990s the flag has been used for many sporting occasions.

            One of the earilest signs of modern day England dates back to the 
            iron age, during which time the Romans invaded and claimed the land
            for the Roman empire, The called this area Britannia which is where
            the term Britain comes from.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Roman empire however was doomed to fail, this left the shores
            of Britannia open for the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians to 
            raid, many believe that these invaders were far more prominent in
            the south eastern regions of the country due to the continued use
            of celtic languages in the north western regions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Information during this age is hard to come by at the best of times
            leading experts to refer to this period in Englands history as 
            the dark ages, it is however believed that these raiding groups eventually
            became part of the culture of England to this day as many of the natives
            have blood that can be traced back to central and northern europe.
        </p>
        <br>

            The beginning of England's Renaissance took place during the Tudor
            period, this was a time where many great works of art were being crafted
            and also where the English protestant church was founded by King Henry VIII.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            England by this time in history was very similar to today, instead of being made up of several different
            kingdoms England was now one Kingdom with several different counties.
