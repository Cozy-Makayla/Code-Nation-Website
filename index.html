        <p>The term United Kingdom or UK for short, became official in 1801 when
            the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland passed an Act of Union.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This united the two kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland together
            into the United Kingdom, this union would only last until 1922 when
            the irish war of independence broke Ireland off from the union.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            However the UK is still a thing to this day, the nations that are still
            apart of this union are;

            In many ways you can see the UK as a state system not to distant from that of
            United States, each member of the UK has their own laws but the UK as a whole
            also has a set of laws which are followed by its members.
