            Located on the north eastern tip of Ireland lies Northen Ireland,
            the founding of this country took place  in 1922 when the mostly
            unionist population of the area wished to remain part of the United Kingdom.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Ever since this divergence of Ireland itself this has remained a controversial subject,
            this is mostly due to religion with Ireland being predominantly Catholic and 
            Northern Ireland being predominantly Protestant.

            Like the other countries within the UK (excluding England), Northern Ireland
            has a form of devolved goverment, this means that they follow the laws of the UK
            and it's policies and having a limited role in policy making.
