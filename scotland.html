                This is the Scottish flag, also known as Saint Andrew's Cross or
                the Saltire.

            <br>
            <p>
                This version of the flag can be traced back to the mid 16th 
                century when it was illustrated in Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount's
                Register of Scottish Arms, try and say that ten times.

                The white cross on blue background form an intergeral part of 
                the United Kingdom Flag.

            The name "Scotland" waas first coined in the 9th century as part of
            the Kingdom of Scotland, but before this time Scotland was known as 
            many different names, the Greek sailor Pytheas refered to the area as 
            "Orcas" which is where the name for the Orkney islands comes from today.

            During the Roman's invasion of Britannia, Scotland remained mostly untouched,
            this however wasn't for lack of trying on the Romans part. One famous incursion
            by the Romans was in 79AD when Agricola invaded the southern region of modern
            day Scotland, this however only lasted a few years before the Romans withdrew from 
            the area.

            At the start of the 6th century the modern day area which is now Scotland 
            was divided into 3 areas, Pictland (a small area of lordships in central Scotland)
            the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria located in the south east of Scotland
            and DÃ¡l Riata, which were settlers that came over from Ireland during this time,
            This is where Scottish Gaelic comes from.
